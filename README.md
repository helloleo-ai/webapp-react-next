This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is set up for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Here's how it works:

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and export your Next.js app.
3. The exported static files will be deployed to the `gh-pages` branch.
4. Your site will be available at `https://[your-username].github.io/webapp-react-next-325b9104-f675-4129-9123-e1d436c6147c/`

To set this up for your own repository:

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section.
3. Set the source to the `gh-pages` branch.
4. Ensure your repository has the necessary permissions for GitHub Actions to deploy.

Note: The first deployment may take a few minutes. Subsequent deployments will be faster.
